# periodic_table_database_project_freecodecamp
This project was done as a part of coursework of Relational database course on freeCodecamp.

You should import the database using the sql file. Then you can run all the scripts in the repository.

There are three script files in this code. 
- First one capitalise the first letter of the symbols in the elements table.
- The second one removes trailing zeros fom the end of atomic masses of elements in the properities table.
- In the third file named element.sh, you should pass an argument. The argument can be the symbol or the atomic number or the name of the element. If you don't pass an argument, it will print to give an argument. If argument that is not in the database is present, then it will print a line explaining the same.
